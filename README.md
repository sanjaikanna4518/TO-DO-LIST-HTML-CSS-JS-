# TO-DO-LIST-HTML-CSS-JS-
I've completed a to-do list project using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The project involved designing a user interface with HTML and CSS, implementing functionality like adding, deleting, and marking tasks complete using JavaScript. The final result is a fully functional to-do list application.
